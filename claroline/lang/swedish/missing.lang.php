Assignment tool is a publication area for students. The course manager creates one or several assignment ( different zones of publication ) where the students will be able to publish their work.<br /><br />
Each assignment can have different objectives or requirements : publication must be a file, or a text or a text and a file, publication can be made for a groupe instead of for a single user,...<br /><br />
Students have the ability to modify their work after submission and the course manager can give them a feedback about their submissions.
</p>
<hr />
<h4>Create an assignment</h4>
<p>To create a new assignment course manager must enter in the assignment tool and click on the link \"Create a new assignment\".
</p>
<p>The form that is shown ask the course manager for&nbsp;:
</p>
<ul><li> a title&nbsp;: the name of the assignment
</li><li> a description&nbsp;: the statement of the assignment, what learners have to do
</li><li> a submission type&nbsp;:
<ul><li> File&nbsp;: any type of file that can be uploaded, keep in mind that there is a size limit that depends on the platform, a text can be joined to describe the file
</li><li> Text only&nbsp;: a text formatted using the wysiwyg editor
</li><li> Text with an attached file&nbsp;: a text formatted using the wysiwyg editor and a file (file is not required)
</li></ul>
</li><li> a start date&nbsp;: date from when the users will be able to post a publication in the assignment
</li><li> a end date&nbsp;: date until when the users will be able to post a publication in the assignment
</li><li> the default publications visibility&nbsp;: choose if the publications will be available or not to others users
</li><li> the assignment type&nbsp;:
<ul><li> individual mode&nbsp;: any authenticated user can post a publication
</li><li> group mode&nbsp;: the user must be a member of at least one group of the course to publish a work and the work will be posted in the name of the group
</li></ul>
</li><li> permission to upload after end date
</li></ul>
<p><br />
<strong>Add an automatic feedback</strong>
</p>
<p>A feedback is a correct version of the assignment.  To add an automatic feedback to an assignment enter the assignment and click on the \"Edit automatic feedback\" link.  </p>
<p>It can be a text or a file or both a text and a file.  The course manager can choose when this automatic feedback will be shown to users ( after assignment end date or after the first submission of the user in this assignment )
</p>
<hr />
<h4>Works</h4>
<p>Works are the publications uploaded by users.</p>
<p>For each assignment the tool shows a list of all users registered in the course and for each user the title of the first work he published, the number of submissions and the number of feedbacks.
The list of publications related to the user and the assignment can be view by clicking on the name of the user.</p>
<p><strong>Submit a work</strong></p>
<p>If the users has the right to submit a work he will be displayed a link to a submit form.</p>
<p><strong>Work list</strong></p>
<p>As a course manager you have the right to edit, delete, make visible/invisible any of the works.  You can also add a feedback for each work.
</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Modify</strong>&nbsp;: If this icon appears it means that user can modify the content of the work, it appears when user is the course manager, when user is looking at his works or at his group works.
</li>
<li> <strong>Delete</strong>&nbsp;: This command allow the course manager to delete a work.
</li>
<li> <strong>Visible</strong>&nbsp;: If this icon appears for a work, it means that the work is visible to the learners. This is just like in the document tool of Claroline. You can change this setting by clicking on the icon.
</li>
<li> <strong>Invisible</strong>&nbsp;: If this icon appears for a work, it means that the work is invisible to the learners. This is just like in the document tool of Claroline. You can change this setting by clicking on the icon.
</li>
<li> <strong>Add feedback</strong>&nbsp;: allows the course manager to publish a feedback about the work of the user.  A feedback can be a file or a text or both with a private comment that only course manager(s) will be able to see and a score in pourcent.

<h2>1. Basic syntax</h2>
<dl class=\"wikiHelp\">
<dt>Creating wiki pages and links between them</dt>
<dd><strong>Wiki words</strong> : Wiki words are words written like <em>WikiWord</em>. Wiki2xhtml automaticaly recognise them as Wiki page links. To create a wiki page or to create a link to a wiki page, edit an existing one and add the title of the page in WikiWord syntax, for example <em>MyPage</em>, then save the page. Wiki2xhtml will automaticaly replace the Wiki Word <em>MyPage</em> with a link to the Wiki page <em>MyPage</em>&nbsp;;</dd>
<dd><strong>Wiki links</strong> : Wiki links are like Hyperlinks (see below) expect that they do not contain any protocol scheme (like <em>http://</em> or <em>ftp://</em>) and thatthey are automaticaly recognise as links to Wiki pages. To create a new page or create a link to an existing one using Wiki links, edit a page and add <code>[page title]</code> or <code>[name of link|title of page]</code> to its content. You can also use this syntax to change the text of a WikiWord link : <code>[name of link|WikiWord]</code>.</dd>
<dt>Hyperlinks</dt>
<dd><code>[url]</code>, <code>[name|url]</code>, <code>[name|url|language]</code> or <code>[name|url|language|title]</code>.&nbsp;;</dd>
<dt>Image inclusion</dt>
<dd><code>((url|alternate text))</code>, <code>((url|alternate text|position))</code> ou <code>((url|alternate text|position|long description))</code>. <br />The position argument can take the following values : L (left), R (right) or C (center).&nbsp;;</dd>
<dd>You can use the syntax as Hyperlinks. For example <code>[title|image.gif]</code>. This syntax is deprecated, consider to use the preceding one&nbsp;;</dd>
<dt>Link to an image</dt>
<dd>same as Hyperlinks but put a 0 in fourth argument to avoid image recognition and get an hyperlink to an image. For example <code>[image|image.gif||0]</code> will display a link to image.gif instead of display the imge itself</dd>
<dt>Layout</dt>
<dd><strong>Italic</strong> : surround your text with two single quotes <code>''text''</code>&nbsp;;</dd>
<dd><strong>Bold</strong> : surround your text with three single quotes underscores <code>'''text'''</code>&nbsp;;</dd>
<dd><strong>Underline</strong> : surround your text with two underscores <code>__text__</code>&nbsp;;</dd>
<dd><strong>Stroke</strong> : surround your text with two minus symbols <code>--text--</code>&nbsp;;</dd>
<dd><strong>Title</strong> : <code>!!!</code>, <code>!!</code>, <code>!</code> respectively for titles, sub-titles and sub-sub-titles&nbsp;;</dd>
<dt>List</dt>
<dd>line starting with <code>*</code> (unordered list) or <code>#</code> (ordered list). You can mix lists (<code>*#*</code>) to create multi-level lists.&nbsp;;</dd>
<dt>Paragraph</dt>
<dd>Separate paragraphs with one or more new lines&nbsp;;</dd>
</dl>
<h2>2. Advanced syntax</h2>
<dl class=\"wikiHelp\">
<dt>Footnote</dt>
<dd><code>\$\$footnote text\$\$</code>&nbsp;;</dd>
<dt>Preformated text</dt>
<dd>begin each line of preformated text with a blank space&nbsp;;</dd>
<dt>Cite block</dt>
<dd><code>&gt;</code> or <code>;:</code> before each line&nbsp;;</dd>
<dt>Horizontal line</dt>
<dd><code>----</code>&nbsp;;</dd>
<dt>Forced line break</dt>
<dd><code>%%%</code>&nbsp;;</dd>
<dt>Acronym</dt>
<dd><code>??acronym??</code> or <code>??acronym|definition??</code>&nbsp;;</dd>
<dt>Inline cite</dt>
<dd><code>{{cite}}</code>, <code>{{cite|language}}</code> or <code>{{cite|language|url}}</code>&nbsp;;</dd>
<dt>Code</dt>
<dd><code>@@your code here@@</code>&nbsp;;</dd>
<dt>Named anchor</dt>
