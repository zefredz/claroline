<li> In the comment column Enter feedback that is given if a student selects that answer.</li>
<li> Adjust the weighting value. The principle of this scoring table is to define proper weight to number of good answers by question. For instance, if you have a question with 4 answers (possibly more than one right) and the student has two wrong and two right, you can give him half of the points, but you can also decide that this is not satisfactory and give, for instance, maximum points (20) if everything is right and zero points in any other combination.

When you create such a question&nbsp;:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Introduce first the text for the question.</li>
<li> Use brackets [...] to define one or more blanks in the text, put the correct answers between the brackets.

<h4>The Pool of questions</h4>
<p>The pool of questions keeps a list of all questions created in the course.  The lists regroups already used question (in one or several exercises) and orphaned question (that are not used in any exercise).</p>
<p>When you delete an exercise, questions of its own are not removed from the database, and can be reused in a new exercise, via the question pool.</p>
<p>The question pool also allows you to reuse the same questions in several exercises.</p>
<p>By default, all questions of your course are shown. You can show the questions related to an exercise, by chosing this one in the drop-down menu "Filter".</p>

At creation (Create groups), groups are emtpy. There are
many ways to fill them:

<li>manually (\'Edit\'),</li>
<li>self-registration by students (Groups settings: \'Self registration allowed...\').</li>
</ul>
These three ways can be combined. You can, for instance, ask students to self-register first.
Then discover that some of them didn\'t and decide then to fill groups automatically in
order to complete them. You can also edit each group to compose membership one student
at a time after or before self-registration and/or automatical filling.</p>
<p>Group filling, whether automatical or manual, works only if there are already students
registered in the course (don\'t mix registration to the course with registration into groups).

 introduction text saying \'This is the introduction text of your course. To

 it is up to you to deactivate the ones you don\'t need. You just have to
 click on \'deactivate\'. Then it goes down to the grey section of your

 reactivate it whenever you want, making it visible to the students once more.</p>
<p>You can add your own pages to your
 Home Page. These pages must be HTML pages (which can be created by any
 Word Processor or Web Composer). Use \'Upload page and link to Homepage\' to
 send your page to the server. The standard header of your website will be
 automatically merged with your new document, so that you just need to
 concentrate on the content. If you want to link from your Home to
 existing websites or pages existing anywhere on the web (even inside your
 own site), use \'Add link on Homepage\' The pages you have added to the Home
 page can deactivated then deleted, where the standard tools can be
