</p>
<hr />
<h4>Works</h4>
<p>Works are the publications uploaded by users.</p>
<p>For each assignment the tool shows a list of all users registered in the course and for each user the title of the first work he published, the number of submissions and the number of feedbacks.

</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Modify</strong>&nbsp;: If this icon appears it means that user can modify the content of the work, it appears when user is the course manager, when user is looking at his works or at his group works.
</li>
<li> <strong>Delete</strong>&nbsp;: This command allow the course manager to delete a work.
</li>
<li> <strong>Visible</strong>&nbsp;: If this icon appears for a work, it means that the work is visible to the learners. This is just like in the document tool of Claroline. You can change this setting by clicking on the icon.
</li>

<h2>1. Basic syntax</h2>
<dl class=\"wikiHelp\">
<dt>Creating wiki pages and links between them</dt>
<dd><strong>Wiki words</strong> : Wiki words are words written like <em>WikiWord</em>. Wiki2xhtml automaticaly recognise them as Wiki page links. To create a wiki page or to create a link to a wiki page, edit an existing one and add the title of the page in WikiWord syntax, for example <em>MyPage</em>, then save the page. Wiki2xhtml will automaticaly replace the Wiki Word <em>MyPage</em> with a link to the Wiki page <em>MyPage</em>&nbsp;;</dd>
<dd><strong>Wiki links</strong> : Wiki links are like Hyperlinks (see below) expect that they do not contain any protocol scheme (like <em>http://</em> or <em>ftp://</em>) and thatthey are automaticaly recognise as links to Wiki pages. To create a new page or create a link to an existing one using Wiki links, edit a page and add <code>[page title]</code> or <code>[name of link|title of page]</code> to its content. You can also use this syntax to change the text of a WikiWord link : <code>[name of link|WikiWord]</code>.</dd>
<dt>Hyperlinks</dt>
<dd><code>[url]</code>, <code>[name|url]</code>, <code>[name|url|language]</code> or <code>[name|url|language|title]</code>.&nbsp;;</dd>
<dt>Image inclusion</dt>
<dd><code>((url|alternate text))</code>, <code>((url|alternate text|position))</code> ou <code>((url|alternate text|position|long description))</code>. <br />The position argument can take the following values : L (left), R (right) or C (center).&nbsp;;</dd>
<dd>You can use the syntax as Hyperlinks. For example <code>[title|image.gif]</code>. This syntax is deprecated, consider to use the preceding one&nbsp;;</dd>
<dt>Link to an image</dt>
<dd>same as Hyperlinks but put a 0 in fourth argument to avoid image recognition and get an hyperlink to an image. For example <code>[image|image.gif||0]</code> will display a link to image.gif instead of display the imge itself</dd>
<dt>Layout</dt>
<dd><strong>Italic</strong> : surround your text with two single quotes <code>''text''</code>&nbsp;;</dd>
<dd><strong>Bold</strong> : surround your text with three single quotes underscores <code>'''text'''</code>&nbsp;;</dd>
<dd><strong>Underline</strong> : surround your text with two underscores <code>__text__</code>&nbsp;;</dd>
<dd><strong>Stroke</strong> : surround your text with two minus symbols <code>--text--</code>&nbsp;;</dd>
<dd><strong>Title</strong> : <code>!!!</code>, <code>!!</code>, <code>!</code> respectively for titles, sub-titles and sub-sub-titles&nbsp;;</dd>
<dt>List</dt>
<dd>line starting with <code>*</code> (unordered list) or <code>#</code> (ordered list). You can mix lists (<code>*#*</code>) to create multi-level lists.&nbsp;;</dd>
