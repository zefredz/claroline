This tool allow you to create online exercises composed of a list of questions. The questions can be of different kinds, students can fill in the exercises and if they are registered to your course, their scores will be stored and visible in the statitiscs of the course.
<hr />
<h4>Administering the exercises</h4>
<p>To create an Exercise</p>
<ul>
<li> Click on \"New exercise\", in the start page of the tool (be sure that you are loggued in as teacher of the course or admin)</li>
<li> Enter a name for the exercise in the box</li>
<li> Enter a description</li>
<li> Choose if the user will see all the questions on a single page or one page for each question</li>
<li> I you want to you can also modify the advanced settings (not required)
<ul>
<li> choose a start date</li>
<li> choose a end date</li>
<li> define a time limit</li>
<li> choose the number of allowed attempts</li>
<li> choose if anonymous attempts are allowed (if not allowed there will be no tracking)</li>
<li> choose when the feedback has to be shown</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Click on Ok</li>
</ul>
<p>You can now fill your new exercises with new questions or questions from the pool.</p>
<hr />
<h4>Questions</h4>
<h4>Multiple choice questions</h4>
<p>There are two kind of multiple choice question&nbsp;:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Question with unique answer</li>
<li> Question with multiple answer</li>
</ul>
<p>In both case, when you start creating a new question, there are only two possible answers displayed. If you wish to have more possible answers then</p>
<ul>
<li> Press +Answ for each additional answer you require</li>
</ul>
<p>If you wish the reduce the amount of possible answers then </p>
<ul>
<li> Press -Answ for each answer to be removed</li>
</ul>
<p>Then for each answer&nbsp;:</p>
<ul>
<li> Place a tick in the checkbox for the correct answer(s).</li>
<li> In the answer column Enter the text for the possible answers to the questions</li>
<li> In the comment column Enter feedback that is given if a student selects that answer.</li>
<li> Adjust the weighting value. The principle of this scoring table is to define proper weight to number of good answers by question. For instance, if you have a question with 4 answers (possibly more than one right) and the student has two wrong and two right, you can give him half of the points, but you can also decide that this is not satisfactory and give, for instance, maximum points (20) if everything is right and zero points in any other combination.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Matching question</h4>
<p>In this type of question, the student will have to find the correspondance between the elements of to distinct list.</p>
<p>When you start creating a new question of that kind, there are only two elements in the two list displayed. If you wish to have more possible elements to correspond then</p>
<ul>
<li> Press +elem for each additional answer you require</li>
</ul>
<p>If you wish the reduce the amount of elements then </p>
<ul>
<li> Press -elem for each answer to be removed</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also define the weighting of each answer, they can not be negative. Don't forget to click on \"ok\" to validate your new question.</p>
<h4>'Fill in blanks' question</h4>
<p>This type of question is a text with some words missing that the student must fill in.
When you create such a question&nbsp;:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Introduce first the text for the question.</li>
<li> Use brackets [...] to define one or more blanks in the text, put the correct answers between the brackets.
<ul>
<li> <em>example:</em> [British people] live in [United Kingdom].</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Click on \"next\" when done</li>
<li> Define the ponderation for each answer</li>
<li> Click on \"Ok\" to validate your new question</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4>The Pool of questions</h4>
<p>The pool of questions keeps a list of all questions created in the course.  The lists regroups already used question (in one or several exercises) and orphaned question (that are not used in any exercise).</p>
<p>When you delete an exercise, questions of its own are not removed from the database, and can be reused in a new exercise, via the question pool.</p>
<p>The question pool also allows you to reuse the same questions in several exercises.</p>
<p>By default, all questions of your course are shown. You can show the questions related to an exercise, by chosing this one in the drop-down menu \"Filter\".</p>
<hr />
<h4>How to see my previous scores ?</h4>

<p>This tool allows to create and manage work groups.
At creation (Create groups), groups are emtpy. There are
many ways to fill them:
<ul><li>automatically ('Fill groups'),</li>
<li>manually ('Edit'),</li>
<li>self-registration by students (Groups settings: 'Self registration allowed...').</li>
</ul>
These three ways can be combined. You can, for instance, ask students to self-register first.
Then discover that some of them didn't and decide then to fill groups automatically in
order to complete them. You can also edit each group to compose membership one student
at a time after or before self-registration and/or automatical filling.</p>
<p>Group filling, whether automatical or manual, works only if there are already students
registered in the course (don't mix registration to the course with registration into groups).
Students list is visible in <b>Users</b> tool. </p><hr noshade size=1>
<p><b>Create groups</b></p>
<p>To create new groups, click on 'Create new group(s)' and determine number of groups to
create. Maximum number of members is optional but we suggest to chose one. If you leave max. field
unchanged, groups size maximum will be infinite.</p><hr noshade size=1>
<p><b>Group settings</b></p>
<p>You can determine Group settings globally (for all groups).
<b>Students are allowed to self-register in groups</b>:
<p>You create empty groups, students self-register.
If you have defined a maximum number, full groups do not accept new members.
This method is good for teachers who do not know the list of students when
creating groups.</p>

Assignment tool is a publication area for students. The course manager creates one or several assignment ( different zones of publication ) where the students will be able to publish their work.<br /><br />
Each assignment can have different objectives or requirements : publication must be a file, or a text or a text and a file, publication can be made for a groupe instead of for a single user,...<br /><br />
Students have the ability to modify their work after submission and the course manager can give them a feedback about their submissions.

</li><li> Text with an attached file&nbsp;: a text formatted using the wysiwyg editor and a file (file is not required)
</li></ul>
</li><li> a start date&nbsp;: date from when the users will be able to post a publication in the assignment
</li><li> a end date&nbsp;: date until when the users will be able to post a publication in the assignment
</li><li> the default publications visibility&nbsp;: choose if the publications will be available or not to others users
</li><li> the assignment type&nbsp;:
<ul><li> individual mode&nbsp;: any authenticated user can post a publication
</li><li> group mode&nbsp;: the user must be a member of at least one group of the course to publish a work and the work will be posted in the name of the group
</li></ul>
</li><li> permission to upload after end date
</li></ul>
<p><br />
<strong>Add an automatic feedback</strong>
</p>
<p>A feedback is a correct version of the assignment.  To add an automatic feedback to an assignment enter the assignment and click on the \"Edit automatic feedback\" link.  </p>
<p>It can be a text or a file or both a text and a file.  The course manager can choose when this automatic feedback will be shown to users ( after assignment end date or after the first submission of the user in this assignment )
</p>
<hr />
<h4>Works</h4>
<p>Works are the publications uploaded by users.</p>
<p>For each assignment the tool shows a list of all users registered in the course and for each user the title of the first work he published, the number of submissions and the number of feedbacks.
The list of publications related to the user and the assignment can be view by clicking on the name of the user.</p>
<p><strong>Submit a work</strong></p>
<p>If the users has the right to submit a work he will be displayed a link to a submit form.</p>

<p>As a course manager you have the right to edit, delete, make visible/invisible any of the works.  You can also add a feedback for each work.
</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Modify</strong>&nbsp;: If this icon appears it means that user can modify the content of the work, it appears when user is the course manager, when user is looking at his works or at his group works.
</li>
<li> <strong>Delete</strong>&nbsp;: This command allow the course manager to delete a work.
</li>
<li> <strong>Visible</strong>&nbsp;: If this icon appears for a work, it means that the work is visible to the learners. This is just like in the document tool of Claroline. You can change this setting by clicking on the icon.
</li>
<li> <strong>Invisible</strong>&nbsp;: If this icon appears for a work, it means that the work is invisible to the learners. This is just like in the document tool of Claroline. You can change this setting by clicking on the icon.
</li>
<li> <strong>Add feedback</strong>&nbsp;: allows the course manager to publish a feedback about the work of the user.  A feedback can be a file or a text or both with a private comment that only course manager(s) will be able to see and a score in pourcent.

 There is a small example in every tool to help you quickly grasp how it
 works. It is up to you to modify the example or to delete it.</p><p>For
 instance, here on the Home Page of your course website,there is a small
 introduction text saying 'This is the introduction text of your course. To
 replace it by your own text, click below on modify.' Click on modify, edit
 it and Ok. It's that simple. Every tool has the same logic:
 add, delete, modify, which is the logic of dynamic websites.</p><p>When
 you first create your website, most of the tools are active. Here again,
 it is up to you to deactivate the ones you don't need. You just have to
 click on 'deactivate'. Then it goes down to the grey section of your
 homepage and becomes invisible to your students.  However, you can
 reactivate it whenever you want, making it visible to the students once more.</p>
<p>You can add your own pages to your
 Home Page. These pages must be HTML pages (which can be created by any
 Word Processor or Web Composer). Use 'Upload page and link to Homepage' to
 send your page to the server. The standard header of your website will be
 automatically merged with your new document, so that you just need to
 concentrate on the content. If you want to link from your Home to
 existing websites or pages existing anywhere on the web (even inside your
 own site), use 'Add link on Homepage' The pages you have added to the Home
 page can deactivated then deleted, where the standard tools can be
 deactivated, but not deleted.</p><p>Once your course website is ready, go
 to 'Modify course info' and decide what level of confidentiality you want.

<h2>1. Basic syntax</h2>
<dl class=\"wikiHelp\">
<dt>Creating wiki pages and links between them</dt>
<dd><strong>Wiki words</strong> : Wiki words are words written like <em>WikiWord</em>. Wiki2xhtml automaticaly recognise them as Wiki page links. To create a wiki page or to create a link to a wiki page, edit an existing one and add the title of the page in WikiWord syntax, for example <em>MyPage</em>, then save the page. Wiki2xhtml will automaticaly replace the Wiki Word <em>MyPage</em> with a link to the Wiki page <em>MyPage</em>&nbsp;;</dd>
<dd><strong>Wiki links</strong> : Wiki links are like Hyperlinks (see below) expect that they do not contain any protocol scheme (like <em>http://</em> or <em>ftp://</em>) and thatthey are automaticaly recognise as links to Wiki pages. To create a new page or create a link to an existing one using Wiki links, edit a page and add <code>[page title]</code> or <code>[name of link|title of page]</code> to its content. You can also use this syntax to change the text of a WikiWord link : <code>[name of link|WikiWord]</code>.</dd>
<dt>Hyperlinks</dt>
<dd><code>[url]</code>, <code>[name|url]</code>, <code>[name|url|language]</code> or <code>[name|url|language|title]</code>.&nbsp;;</dd>
<dt>Image inclusion</dt>
<dd><code>((url|alternate text))</code>, <code>((url|alternate text|position))</code> ou <code>((url|alternate text|position|long description))</code>. <br />The position argument can take the following values : L (left), R (right) or C (center).&nbsp;;</dd>
<dd>You can use the syntax as Hyperlinks. For example <code>[title|image.gif]</code>. This syntax is deprecated, consider to use the preceding one&nbsp;;</dd>
<dt>Link to an image</dt>
<dd>same as Hyperlinks but put a 0 in fourth argument to avoid image recognition and get an hyperlink to an image. For example <code>[image|image.gif||0]</code> will display a link to image.gif instead of display the imge itself</dd>
<dt>Layout</dt>
<dd><strong>Italic</strong> : surround your text with two single quotes <code>''text''</code>&nbsp;;</dd>
<dd><strong>Bold</strong> : surround your text with three single quotes underscores <code>'''text'''</code>&nbsp;;</dd>
<dd><strong>Underline</strong> : surround your text with two underscores <code>__text__</code>&nbsp;;</dd>
<dd><strong>Stroke</strong> : surround your text with two minus symbols <code>--text--</code>&nbsp;;</dd>
<dd><strong>Title</strong> : <code>!!!</code>, <code>!!</code>, <code>!</code> respectively for titles, sub-titles and sub-sub-titles&nbsp;;</dd>
<dt>List</dt>
<dd>line starting with <code>*</code> (unordered list) or <code>#</code> (ordered list). You can mix lists (<code>*#*</code>) to create multi-level lists.&nbsp;;</dd>
