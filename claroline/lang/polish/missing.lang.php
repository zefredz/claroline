<h2>1. Basic syntax</h2>
<dl class=\"wikiHelp\">
<dt>Creating wiki pages and links between them</dt>
<dd><strong>Wiki words</strong> : Wiki words are words written like <em>WikiWord</em>. Wiki2xhtml automaticaly recognise them as Wiki page links. To create a wiki page or to create a link to a wiki page, edit an existing one and add the title of the page in WikiWord syntax, for example <em>MyPage</em>, then save the page. Wiki2xhtml will automaticaly replace the Wiki Word <em>MyPage</em> with a link to the Wiki page <em>MyPage</em>&nbsp;;</dd>
<dd><strong>Wiki links</strong> : Wiki links are like Hyperlinks (see below) expect that they do not contain any protocol scheme (like <em>http://</em> or <em>ftp://</em>) and thatthey are automaticaly recognise as links to Wiki pages. To create a new page or create a link to an existing one using Wiki links, edit a page and add <code>[page title]</code> or <code>[name of link|title of page]</code> to its content. You can also use this syntax to change the text of a WikiWord link : <code>[name of link|WikiWord]</code>.</dd>
<dt>Hyperlinks</dt>
<dd><code>[url]</code>, <code>[name|url]</code>, <code>[name|url|language]</code> ou <code>[name|url|language|title]</code>.&nbsp;;</dd>
<dt>Image inclusion</dt>
<dd><code>((url|alternate text))</code>, <code>((url|alternate text|position))</code> ou <code>((url|alternate text|position|long description))</code>. <br>The position argument can take the following values : L (left), R (right) or C (centeré).&nbsp;;</dd>
<dd>You can use the syntax as Hyperlinks. For example <code>[title|image.gif]</code>. This syntax is deprecated, consider to use the preceding one&nbsp;;</dd>
<dt>Link to an image</dt>
<dd>same as Hyperlinks but put a 0 in fourth argument to avoid image recognition and get an hyperlink to an image. For example <code>[image|image.gif||0]</code> will display a link to image.gif instead of display the imge itself</dd>
<dt>Layout</dt>
<dd><strong>Italic</strong> : surround your text with two single quotes <code>''text''</code>&nbsp;;</dd>
<dd><strong>Bold</strong> : surround your text with three single quotes underscores <code>'''text'''</code>&nbsp;;</dd>
<dd><strong>Underline</strong> : surround your text with two underscores <code>__text__</code>&nbsp;;</dd>
<dd><strong>Stroke</strong> : surround your text with two minus symbols <code>--text--</code>&nbsp;;</dd>
<dd><strong>Title</strong> : <code>!!!</code>, <code>!!</code>, <code>!</code> respectively for titles, sub-titles and sub-sub-titles&nbsp;;</dd>
<dt>List</dt>
