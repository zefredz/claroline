This tool allow you to create online exercises composed of a list of questions. The questions can be of different kinds, students can fill in the exercises and if they are registered to your course, their scores will be stored and visible in the statitiscs of the course.
<hr />
<h4>Administering the exercises</h4>
<p>To create an Exercise</p>
<ul>
<li> Click on \"New exercise\", in the start page of the tool (be sure that you are loggued in as teacher of the course or admin)</li>
<li> Enter a name for the exercise in the box</li>
<li> Enter a description</li>
<li> Choose if the user will see all the questions on a single page or one page for each question</li>
<li> I you want to you can also modify the advanced settings (not required)
<ul>
<li> choose a start date</li>
<li> choose a end date</li>
<li> define a time limit</li>
<li> choose the number of allowed attempts</li>
<li> choose if anonymous attempts are allowed (if not allowed there will be no tracking)</li>
<li> choose when the feedback has to be shown</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Click on Ok</li>

<h4>Questions</h4>
<h4>Multiple choice questions</h4>
<p>There are two kind of multiple choice question&nbsp;:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Question with unique answer</li>
<li> Question with multiple answer</li>
</ul>
<p>In both case, when you start creating a new question, there are only two possible answers displayed. If you wish to have more possible answers then</p>
<ul>
<li> Press +Answ for each additional answer you require</li>
</ul>
<p>If you wish the reduce the amount of possible answers then </p>
<ul>
<li> Press -Answ for each answer to be removed</li>
</ul>
<p>Then for each answer&nbsp;:</p>
<ul>
<li> Place a tick in the checkbox for the correct answer(s).</li>
<li> In the answer column Enter the text for the possible answers to the questions</li>
<li> In the comment column Enter feedback that is given if a student selects that answer.</li>
<li> Adjust the weighting value. The principle of this scoring table is to define proper weight to number of good answers by question. For instance, if you have a question with 4 answers (possibly more than one right) and the student has two wrong and two right, you can give him half of the points, but you can also decide that this is not satisfactory and give, for instance, maximum points (20) if everything is right and zero points in any other combination.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Matching question</h4>
<p>In this type of question, the student will have to find the correspondance between the elements of to distinct list.</p>
<p>When you start creating a new question of that kind, there are only two elements in the two list displayed. If you wish to have more possible elements to correspond then</p>
<ul>
<li> Press +elem for each additional answer you require</li>
</ul>
<p>If you wish the reduce the amount of elements then </p>
<ul>
<li> Press -elem for each answer to be removed</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also define the weighting of each answer, they can not be negative. Don't forget to click on \"ok\" to validate your new question.</p>
<h4>'Fill in blanks' question</h4>
<p>This type of question is a text with some words missing that the student must fill in.
When you create such a question&nbsp;:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Introduce first the text for the question.</li>
<li> Use brackets [...] to define one or more blanks in the text, put the correct answers between the brackets.
<ul>
<li> <em>example:</em> [British people] live in [United Kingdom].</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Click on \"next\" when done</li>
<li> Define the ponderation for each answer</li>
<li> Click on \"Ok\" to validate your new question</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4>The Pool of questions</h4>
<p>The pool of questions keeps a list of all questions created in the course.  The lists regroups already used question (in one or several exercises) and orphaned question (that are not used in any exercise).</p>
<p>When you delete an exercise, questions of its own are not removed from the database, and can be reused in a new exercise, via the question pool.</p>
<p>The question pool also allows you to reuse the same questions in several exercises.</p>
<p>By default, all questions of your course are shown. You can show the questions related to an exercise, by chosing this one in the drop-down menu \"Filter\".</p>
<hr />

Then discover that some of them didn't and decide then to fill groups automatically in
order to complete them. You can also edit each group to compose membership one student

 There is a small example in every tool to help you quickly grasp how it
 works. It is up to you to modify the example or to delete it.</p><p>For
 instance, here on the Home Page of your course website,there is a small
 introduction text saying 'This is the introduction text of your course. To
 replace it by your own text, click below on modify.' Click on modify, edit
 it and Ok. It's that simple. Every tool has the same logic:
 add, delete, modify, which is the logic of dynamic websites.</p><p>When
 you first create your website, most of the tools are active. Here again,
 it is up to you to deactivate the ones you don't need. You just have to
 click on 'deactivate'. Then it goes down to the grey section of your
 homepage and becomes invisible to your students.  However, you can
 reactivate it whenever you want, making it visible to the students once more.</p>
<p>You can add your own pages to your
 Home Page. These pages must be HTML pages (which can be created by any
 Word Processor or Web Composer). Use 'Upload page and link to Homepage' to
 send your page to the server. The standard header of your website will be
 automatically merged with your new document, so that you just need to
 concentrate on the content. If you want to link from your Home to
 existing websites or pages existing anywhere on the web (even inside your
 own site), use 'Add link on Homepage' The pages you have added to the Home
 page can deactivated then deleted, where the standard tools can be
 deactivated, but not deleted.</p><p>Once your course website is ready, go
 to 'Modify course info' and decide what level of confidentiality you want.
 By default, your course is hidden (because you work on it).</p>";
